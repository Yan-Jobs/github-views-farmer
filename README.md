# GitHub views farmer 
Have you seen this cool badges that count your views and appears in your readme ? But you have reset your views and now it’s to 0 :(. With github-views-farmer you can get back that amount, and more ;)
# Install

<code>git clone git@github.com:Yan-Jobs/github-views-farmer.git</code>
2. If you are on macOS/Linux, make the script executable, and run it
<code>chmod +x ./bash/views.sh</code>
2. If you are on Windows go to the `batch` folder, and double click on it. 
3. Fill in the number of views you want to recover (please don’t us this to boost your stats, please)
4. Enter the URL of the tracker, it should be an image URL (GitHub is fine if you want, for me it’s `https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=yan-jobs`)
5. Enjoy your recover ;)
